A simple discord bot for my server.

Uses discord.py and hosted on Heroku. Primary function is to provide us with disscussion topics, which it pulls from [another repository](https://github.com/regalhotpocket/questions). Can also generate questions based on the method described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2ife6d/pykov_a_tiny_python_module_on_finite_regular/cl3bybj/).
